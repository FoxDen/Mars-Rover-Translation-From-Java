# Mars Rover Translation From Java

This was done as a project. The task was to create a 'map' of the surface of Mars and then place rovers down at certain points. These rovers had three options. Move (M), Turn Left (L), Turn Right (R). There could be more than one rover put down, which I accounted for. There were also several catchable exceptions and edge cases in this project that I implemented.

# The steps to running this project:

1) Execute the .EXE file. 
2) Input a space, executed as an 'x by x' map.
3) Set the starting point and pointed direction of the rover on the map.
4) Input the string to move the rovers. (Ex: MLMMRM -> Move, Turn Left, Move, Move, Turn Right, Move. ) 
5) If not done, input another starting space for the rover and input another string.
6) Once you're ready to quit, press enter again.
